# React Lab 🚀

Welcome! This repository documents my journey of learning React — from fundamentals to real-world project patterns.

I’m building a series of progressively more advanced examples and micro-projects, each in its own folder, complete with source code, documentation, and reflection notes.

## 🌱 Why This Exists

* To solidify my React knowledge through hands-on coding.
* To build a public portfolio of learnings and small projects.
* To help others who are learning React by sharing working examples.

## 🧭 Topics Covered

* ✅ JSX, components, and props
* ✅ `useState`, `useEffect`, and basic hooks
* ⏳ Context API and custom hooks
* ⏳ Routing and advanced patterns
* ⏳ Testing with React Testing Library
* ⏳ Deployment to GitHub Pages / Netlify

Each folder includes:

* 📄 `README.md` with what I’m trying to learn
* 📁 Source code (React app or snippet)
* 📝 Reflection notes

## 🚧 How to Use

## 🧪 Creating a New React App with Vite

To scaffold a new React project in one of the subdirectories (e.g., `02-hooks/use-reducer-demo`):

```bash
cd new_project
npm create vite@latest . -- --template react
npm install
npm run dev
```

or

```shell
npm create vite@latest new_project -- --template react
cd new_project
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🧪 Examples Available

* [useState Counter](02-hooks/use-state-counter)
* [useEffect Fetch](02-hooks/use-effect-fetch)
